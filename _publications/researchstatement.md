1. Research Interests
   ---
The domain of environmental economics and subcategories hosted within namely, natural
resource economics, policy analysis, land use planning, energy, sustainability, and ecological
economics fascinate me and provoke use as topics for my research. My dissertation explores
federal environmental system management regarding planning, goals, functionalities and their
role in the allocation of natural resources.

2. Dissertation
   ---
Specifically, my dissertation evaluates the nature of tradeoffs, uncertainty, and rules vs discretion
in US army corps of engineer reservoir operations. A critical part of this work analyzes the
interaction of federal environmental system managers and the federal court system regarding
environmental legislation and dam multifunctionality. Through my dissertation I have developed
competency in several empirical methods. I have experience designing estimation procedures for
panel and cross sectional data for different types of dependent variables. I aggregated time
periods of dam performance and reproduced the results of (Patterson 2018) with additional data
and estimation based on a theoretical model of environmental system management behavior. I
developed managerial target data from water control manuals and forecast data. I have
experience in anomalous observation identification I used to assess the impact of extreme
streamflow occurrence on dam operations. My job market paper employs a hazard regression to
identify the legal vulnerability of federally managed dams. This endeavor required technical
management of complicated text data and web interfacing skills.

3. Other Experience
   ---
I have garnered experience collaborating with biological systems engineers, hydrologists,
ecologists, and biologists through a NSF Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems
(DISES) grant. This exposure to interdisciplinary systems analysis bolsters my research capacity
to wholistically consider research questions and apply economic insight to studies from other
fields. Working with this teams has granted me the opportunity to engage with external
stakeholders and industry professionals in the realm of environmental systems management. I
find the application of industry testimony and synthesis of their lived narrative into an
understanding of economic phenomena aptly incorporated into my research.

4. Future Publication Plans
   ---
My goal is to contribute to the sum of environmental economics literature with innovative
research in topical and growing fields with wide impacts. I am eager to deepen the communal
understanding of underserved concepts as well. My dedication to scholarly cohesion primes me
to objectively serve as a reviewer should I be called upon in the future.
