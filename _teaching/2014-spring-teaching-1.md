I have a reverent, equitable, and pragmatic approach to education. I believe in time tested strategies for effective
learning coupled with modern practices to maximize engagement and retention. My goal as an educator is to
connect people to ideas, facilitate opportunities to advance knowledge and prepare students for future
educational and professional endeavors.
1. Philosophy
Humility is a core virtue of my approach, learning from mistakes and encountering information with an open mind
is conducive to greater understanding. Leadership by example is a hallmark of my instruction style. I find students
are receptive to demonstrations with class participation and working through problems together. Repetition has its
place, redundant correspondence of information promotes retention and delivering the same concepts in different
ways can allow for deeper understanding. Collaboration is fundamental to workplace readiness, so I encourage
teamwork and peer to peer assistance. I understand I have a bias favoring the pursuit of economic education. I use
this as an advantage by serving as an ambassador for economics at large reinforcing classroom curiosity and
extending classroom curriculum for eager students.
2. Application
Student engagement and critical thinking are bolstered by applying curriculum to current and historical world
events. Individualized learning is effective. I make a conscious effort to adapt to the learning styles my students
respond to. I recognize different students have different needs and fostering a learning environment where
information is accessible to all students is the ideal I aim to achieve. Economic principles are reinforced and
demonstrated through the coursework grading scheme which incentivizes participation and review. At times
interdisciplinary involvement spurs engagement. Not every student prioritizes economics and that is an
opportunity to relate economic topics to other fields and world events.
3. Educational Environment
An environment conducive to learning is paramount to successful instruction. Function follows form and the
classroom is no exception. What this means is that laying the groundwork for a structured supportive classroom
ultimately returns higher student performance by the end of the class. Communication is more efficient when the
expectations of both the students and instructor are managed. Establishing my classroom as a safe space for
learning is a hallmark of my teaching style. My students know that I will not dispense judgement which inspires
classroom interaction. Furthermore, a routine dispensary of novel curriculum tandem to an outlined schedule of
review primes students for organized learning and better retention. I believe institutions of learning are also places
of community. I strive to have a presence in the community where I work, it allows me to develop a familiarity with
the local values and make material more accessible. Creating a safe space classroom means that students can
trust me should they feel unsafe or have another concern, I will believe them and connect them with appropriate
resources. Part of a wholistic educational environment is making yourself available to students outside of the
classroom and I follow this practice with my office hours and institutional presence.
4. Engagement
I supply my class periods with a passion for learning and a vigor for economics. I have an involved lecture style
where I instigate discussions with the class as a whole and I have a sense this resonates with students. Repetition
sounds boring at a glance but it also gives students confidence when they feel more secure about the material.
This confidence translates readily into class participation which in a virtuous cycle enhances learning. My keen
and growing pedagogy skills facilitate independent learning as I focus on instilling my students with a tool set for
generic problem solving they can apply broadly which incentivizes their engagement. Part of being an engaging
educator is keeping up with current trends in teaching. My activity at economics conferences supports this
segment of my teaching skillset as I embrace the strategies of other educators. I also stay current by following a
few podcasts like “EconTalk” with Russ Roberts and the “Anything But Dismal Podcast”.
5. Experience
My background is more diverse than most. Part of the beauty of economics is that its suitable for a wide range of
audiences and I have had the opportunity to engage with students at different levels. At Washington State
University I have been a TA for a 1st year PhD Microeconomic theory course, I was a section instructor for an MBA
managerial economics master’s program, and I have taught multiple undergraduate courses at the 100-400 level
as the sole instructor of record. I held an adjunct teaching position for Spokane Falls community college teaching
Macroeconomics. In my undergraduate degree at Arizona State University, I was a student employee at the
economics tutoring center assisting my peers and I was also an officer of the student economics association
where we spoke to middle school classrooms about economics. Experience is the best teacher, and teaching is
the best experience. My exposure to students with diverse backgrounds qualifies me to explain material in different
ways to different audiences and has also uplifted my own mastery of the material by witnessing how it’s processed
individually.
