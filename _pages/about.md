Welcome to my website!

I am deeply passionate about economics. My specific areas of focus are environmental, managerial, and resource economics. My work revolves around developing a deeper understanding of environmental management systems and the application of principled economic frameworks to guide sustainable and optimal natural resource usage and inform policy decisions. With a keen interest in analyzing complex stochastic systems, I approach research with precision and collaboration, grounding my conclusions in sound data and theory while internalizing the ideas from area experts and interdisciplinary works. As a researcher and educator, I strive to enhance the accessibility of economic findings and contribute to a broader service of provisioning novel information to the masses. I am a self-motivated and goal-oriented individual with uncompromised integrity and unbridled curiosity. I am a leader, a team player, and a lifelong learner.

Throughout my career, I've developed an array of technical and soft skills that bolster my ability to solve problems and communicate economic insights, in writing, speaking, and otherwise. Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at Washington State University independently teaching microeconomics, a comprehensive description of my teaching can be found under the teaching section. I began my pursuit of economic understanding at Arizona State University where I also garnered experience in the technology and healthcare industries. My goal is to bridge the gap between economic theory and real-world applications, foster more informed dialogue that leads to impactful positive world outcomes, and serve the greater good as a steward of the environment.
